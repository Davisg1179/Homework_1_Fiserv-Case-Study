## Overview and Origin

<div style="text-align: justify">Fiserv was founded in 1984, by George Dalton and Leslie Muma, and quickly grew, mainly as a result of acquisitions - totalling over thrity between 1991 and 2020.  Dalton and Muma independently operated their own data processing companies and wanted to merge the two since the late 1970s.  The subsidiaries headed by Dalton and Muma in their separate companies finally were finally merged into a single entity called Fiserv with venture capital backing.  Headquartered in Bookfield, Wisconsin, Fiserv is a leading provider of payments and financial services technology solutions.

However, this list does not take into account the technolgies that Fiserv has adopted through its numerous acquisitions over the years.

## Landscape

The main financial industry domain Fiserv operates in is payments and billing.  A major trend in the payments and billing domain is consumer transition to digital payments for goods and services.  In 2019, Fobes published an article, "The Future of Payments: Fintech 50 2019," in which they report data from Accenture revealing funding for payments compainies jumped from $8 billion in 2017 to $12 billion in 2018.  True, digital payment options have been around for several years, but the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have spurred on the increasing trend.  In fact, according to a study done by ACI Worldwide, the percentage of consumers paying some of their bills through automated recurring payments has increased from 55.4% in 2019 to 62% in 2020.  Fiserv itself published a white paper, "Four Trends to Watch in Wire Payments," where they ouline what they are hearing from their customers.  The trends that were most common across their customers were the effect of real-time payments, rising fraud, dwindling fees, and payments modernization.  Fiserv sees a growing market for consummers that want point-of-sale financing and other buy-now-pay-later options.  A few of Fiserv's competitors include Diebold Nixdorf, ACI Worldwide, Assurant, Jack Henry & Associates, and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS). 

## Results

According to Fiserv's 2020, 10-K report, the company had $14.9 billion in total revenue and $4.1 billion of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations.  Processing and services revenue accounted for 82% of their revenue in 2020, which is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts that have high renewal rates.  Business growth is achieved by signing new clients, expanding the products and services provided to existing clients, offering new and enhanced products and services developed through innovation and acquisition, and extending the business geographically.  Currently, its customer base includes over 5,000 customers.  In comparison to its competitors, Fiserv was leading in revenue for 2020.  A search in Yahoo Finance revealed that Diebold Nixdorf, ACI Worldwide, Assurant, Jack Henry & Associates, and FIS had 2020, reported revenues of $3.9 billion, $1.3 billion, $10 billion, $1.7 billion, and $12.5 billion, respectively.  Indicating, that relative to their major competitors, Fiserv is leading in revenue for this domain.  Comparably ranks first in Net Promoter Score at 24 with its closest competitor, FIS, having a score of 16 indicating that customers recommend Fiserv's services over their competitors.

## Recommendations

It is clear that digital payment options are not going away.  The COVID-19 pandemic increased the need for contactless, safer, and secure digital transactions.  Therefore a recommendation going forward for Fiserv would be to create and support more real-time payment methods with payment confirmation.  Such an innovation would directly speak to one of the trends they outlined in their white paper, point-of-sale financing as a buy-now-pay-later option.  To this end, an idea would be to have Fiserv match consumers with creditors that are already in Fiserv's network in real-time.  For example, a customer at a furniture store would like to purchase furniture for their home, and the store does not offer any form of financing.  The consumer has consented through their own financial institution to allow their information to be shared with Fiserv in a secure manner.  The consumer would make a request on the app, and Fiserv would match the consumer with a financial institution that would be willing to credit him with the money.  It might be with the consumer's current financial institution or another institution within Finserv's network that has agreed to part of this type of network.  After the purchase, the consumer would then be able to make payments to the financial institution again using the bill payment options that Fiserv provides.  In this way, Fiserv continues to operate as it always has by deliver solutions, and this feature does not require Fiserv to financially back the consumer.  Offering this service would not only diversify their current offerings, it would also strengthen their existing products and services because they consumer would use the native applications in order to repay the financial institution that financed the money for them.  This idea would leverage their core in-house technologies, but an additional element would need to be created or added.  Fiserv would need to create a system that would send the consumer information to the various financial institutions in their network so that the particular financial institution could assess the creditworthiness of the consumer using the existing metrics for that institution.
